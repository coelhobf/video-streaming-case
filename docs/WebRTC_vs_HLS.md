# WebRTC vs HLS Analysis

## HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)

**Protocol**: HTTP-based adaptive bitrate streaming
**Transport**: Standard HTTP over TCP  
**Method**: Segmented video files with manifest playlists

**When to choose HLS:**
- Content distribution at scale
- Pre-recorded content with seek functionality
- Mobile device streaming
- CDN distribution requirements

**Advantages:**
- Infinite horizontal scaling via CDNs
- Universal browser and device support
- Automatic adaptive bitrate adjustment
- Uses existing HTTP infrastructure
- TCP reliability guarantees
- HTTP responses easily cached

**Limitations:**
- High latency (6-30 seconds typical)
- Not suitable for live interaction
- HTTP header overhead per segment
- Requires segment storage and caching

## WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)

**Protocol**: Peer-to-peer communication standard
**Transport**: UDP-based with SRTP encryption
**Method**: Direct real-time media streams

**When to choose WebRTC:**
- Live interaction requirements
- Real-time applications (gaming, monitoring)
- Sub-second latency needed
- Two-way communication scenarios

**Advantages:**
- Ultra-low latency (100-500ms end-to-end)
- Perfect for live interaction
- Direct P2P with minimal server overhead
- Dynamic bitrate and quality adjustment
- Built-in encryption (SRTP)
- No browser plugins required

**Limitations:**
- Complex scaling for large audiences
- Network sensitive, struggles with poor connections
- Higher CPU and bandwidth usage
- Complex signaling setup required
- Some browser compatibility limitations

## Decision Matrix

| Use Case | Recommended | Latency | Scalability |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Live Sports Broadcasting | HLS | 10-30s | Excellent |
| Video Conferencing | WebRTC | <500ms | Limited |
| Security Camera Monitoring | WebRTC | <1s | Moderate |
| Movie Streaming | HLS | 15-30s | Excellent |
| Live Gaming Stream | HLS | 10-20s | Excellent |
| Interactive Live Stream | WebRTC | <500ms | Limited |
| Educational Videos | HLS | 10-30s | Excellent |
| Remote Device Control | WebRTC | <200ms | Very Limited |

## Implementation

**Current Setup:**
- WebRTC for real-time monitoring
- HLS for scalable distribution

**Why Both:**
- WebRTC provides immediate live viewing for operators
- HLS enables large-scale distribution for end users
- Users can choose based on latency requirements

**Configuration:**
- HLS: Low latency variant (6-8s latency)
- WebRTC: Direct WHEP connection (<500ms latency)
